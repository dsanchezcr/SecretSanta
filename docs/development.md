# 🎯 Developer Setup Guide - Overview

Welcome to Secret Santa! This guide helps you choose the right documentation for your needs.

## 📚 Documentation Roadmap

### ☁️ For Cloud Development (Recommended for Beginners)

**Start here:** [codespaces-setup.md](codespaces-setup.md)

- ✅ **30-Second Quick Start** - No installation needed
- ✅ **Browser-Based Development** - Everything in VS Code web
- ✅ **Full-Stack Debugging** - F5 works same as local
- ✅ **Docker-in-Docker** - Containers run inside Codespace
- ✅ **Performance Tips** - How to make Codespaces faster
- ✅ **Troubleshooting** - Common Codespaces issues

**What you'll do:**
```bash
# 1. Click Codespaces badge in README
# 2. Wait 60 seconds for container to build
# 3. Press F5 in browser-based VS Code
# 4. Click notification to open frontend
```

**Perfect for:**
- ✅ Trial/learning the app
- ✅ Quick bug fixes
- ✅ Reviewing PRs
- ✅ No local setup required
- ✅ Works on any device with a browser

---

### 🚀 For Local Development (You're starting fresh)

**Start here:** [getting-started.md](getting-started.md)

- ✅ **Quick Start** (5 minutes) - Get running with one debug command
- ✅ **Development Workflow** - Understand file structure and hot reload
- ✅ **Debugging** - VS Code breakpoints for frontend and API
- ✅ **Database Management** - View/reset Cosmos DB locally

**Deep dive:** [local-development-setup.md](local-development-setup.md) - How local settings are auto-configured

**Key files for local dev:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Cosmos DB + Azurite containers
- `api/local.settings.json` - Local API configuration (auto-generated)
- `.vscode/launch.json` - VS Code debug configurations
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build/run tasks

**What you'll do:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d          # Start Cosmos DB + Azurite
# Open VS Code
F5                            # Start debugging (🚀 Full Stack)
# App opens at http://localhost:5173
```

**What happens automatically:**
```
1. Push to GitHub
   ↓
2. CI/CD runs: Build → Test → Deploy to QA → Test QA
   ↓
3. Manual approval needed
   ↓
4. Auto-deploys to Production
   ↓
5. Status posted to PR/Actions
```

## 🎓 Learning Paths

### Path 1: I want to develop in the cloud (easiest)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Click Codespaces badge"] --> B["Wait 60 seconds"]
    B --> C["Press F5"]
    C --> D["Start coding!"]
```

**Time: 5 minutes (after container builds)**

[📖 Full Codespaces Guide](codespaces-setup.md)

---

### Path 2: I want to develop locally
graph LR
    A["Read getting-started.md"] --> B["Setup Docker Compose"]
    B --> C["Run: docker-compose up -d"]
    C --> D["Press F5 in VS Code"]
    D --> E["Start coding!"]
    E --> F["Run tests: npm run test:e2e"]
```

**Time: 15 minutes**

---

### Path 3: I want to set up CI/CD

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Read github-deployment.md"] --> B["Create Service Principal"]
    B --> C["Add GitHub Secrets"]
    C --> D["Add GitHub Variables"]
    D --> E["Configure Environments"]
    E --> F["Protect main branch"]
    F --> G["Ready to deploy!"]
```

**Time: 30 minutes**

---

### Path 4: I want to do all three (first-time contributor)

```
1. Follow Path 1 (Cloud Development - EASIEST START)
   └─ Get app running in Codespaces
   └─ Make a test change
   └─ See hot reload

2. Or follow Path 2 (Local Development - if you prefer your machine)
   └─ Get app running locally
   └─ Make a test change
   └─ Run local tests

3. Push to feature branch
   └─ GitHub creates PR
   └─ CI/CD auto-creates preview environment

4. Review preview URL in PR comment
   └─ Test your changes
   └─ See real infrastructure deployed

5. Merge to main (after approval)
   └─ CI/CD auto-deploys to QA
   └─ QA tests run
   └─ Manual approval needed
   └─ Auto-deploys to production

6. Follow Path 3 (only if you're a maintainer)
   └─ Set up service principal (one-time)
   └─ Configure GitHub secrets
```

**Time: 1-2 hours end-to-end**

---

### Path 3: I want to do both (first-time contributor)

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Local Development ([getting-started.md](getting-started.md))

**What's included locally:**
- ✅ Cosmos DB Emulator (in Docker)
- ✅ Azurite Storage Emulator (in Docker)
- ✅ Azure Functions (locally)
- ✅ Vite dev server (locally)
- ❌ Email (disabled by default)

**Runs at:** `http://localhost:5173`

**Database:** Emulated Cosmos DB, data persists in Docker volume

**Perfect for:** Feature development, debugging, testing

---

### CI/CD Deployment ([github-deployment.md](github-deployment.md))

**What's included in CI/CD:**
- ✅ Automated testing (build, lint, E2E)
- ✅ Automatic PR preview environments
- ✅ QA deployment with full infrastructure
- ✅ Production deployment (with approval)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on PR close
- ✅ Environment variables auto-configured

**Environments:**
- **PR Environment**: Ephemeral (deleted when PR closes)
- **QA Environment**: Persistent (for testing)
- **Production**: Persistent (live app)

**Costs:** $30-150/month for prod + QA

## ⚡ Pro Tips

### For Developers

```bash
# Hot reload works for both frontend and API
# Edit code → auto-save → auto-reload

# Debug with breakpoints
# Add breakpoint → Refresh/Call endpoint → Step through code

# Run E2E tests before pushing
npm run test:e2e:ui  # See tests in browser

# Check your changes against QA environment
# Open preview URL from PR comment
# Test on multiple browsers/devices

# Clean rebuild if weird issues
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d

```

### For DevOps/Maintainers

```bash
# View deployment status
gh run list --workflow ci-cd.yml

# View Azure resources
az group list --output table
az resource list --resource-group secretsanta --output table

# Check costs
az billing invoice list --output table

# Emergency rollback
# Redeploy previous commit via GitHub Actions
# Or manually run: az deployment group create --template-file infra/main.bicep
```
